# Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example


www-widgetapi.js:1119 Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'DOMWindow': The target origin provided ('https://www.youtube.com') does not match the recipient window's origin ('http://localhost:3000').

This is called cross origin resource sharing and it is a warning in case a website does not permit you to display their content on a different website. Fortunately, youtube does allow you to use their videos. On my end, it looks like the warning is due to their ad-embedded content. The content should otherwise work.
